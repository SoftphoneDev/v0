# Bauhaus-Brutalism Design System Example

This project demonstrates a design system inspired by a blend of Bauhaus principles and Brutalist aesthetics, built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org).

## Philosophy

The core idea is to combine the foundational principles of the Bauhaus movement with the raw, expressive elements of Brutalism.

### Bauhaus Influence

Originating in the early 20th century, the Bauhaus school emphasized the integration of art, craft, and technology. Its core tenets reflected in this project include:

*   **Form Follows Function:** Design is driven by purpose and usability, eliminating unnecessary ornamentation.
*   **Geometric Simplicity:** Clean lines, basic shapes (squares, circles, triangles), and grid-based layouts create structure and clarity.
*   **Primary Colors:** A restrained palette focusing on primary colors (red, blue, yellow) alongside black and white.
*   **Minimalism:** Functional and uncluttered interfaces.
*   **Sans-serif Typography:** Clear, legible text prioritizing readability.

### Brutalist Elements

Brutalism, emerging later, often features raw, exposed materials and a bold, imposing presence. This project incorporates Brutalist aspects through:

*   **Bold Color Accents:** Vibrant, high-contrast colors (cyan, fuchsia, lime, orange) used intentionally.
*   **Raw Textures & Feel:** Monospaced fonts and strong borders evoke a sense of unpolished structure.
*   **Asymmetrical Layouts:** Deliberate breaks from perfect symmetry to create visual tension.
*   **Strong Visual Hierarchy:** Clear distinctions between elements using bold typography and borders.

This project explores how these two distinct styles can coexist to create a unique and functional design language.

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result. You can navigate through the different sections (Overview, Typography, Colors, Components) to see the design system in action.
